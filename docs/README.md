## User Behavior Analytics

### Objective:	
To aggregate and analyze machine data for Operational Intelligence using User Behavior Analytics(UBA) model. It creates multi-dimensional behavior baselines around users, service accounts, devices, and applications then executing unsupervised machine learning algorithms to generate anomalies and threats. Thus providing Insider security for an organization.

### Introduction:	

Cyberattacks are sophisticated and itâ€™s difficult to find hidden threats early-yet early detection is critical to preventing the loss of confidential and sensitive enterprise and customer data. 

While sophisticated threats like APTs and insider attacks hide within the enterprise, indications of breaches can be gleaned by analyzing data. Locating a breach requires advanced detection methods such as finding dynamic and polymorphic threat patterns and identifying behavior of threat actors over weeks, months and even years.

### Use Case:	
 - Advanced Threat Detection
 - Higher Productivity
 - Threat Hunting
 - Enhance Visibility and Detection
 - Fraudulent website Activity

### Outcome:	
Providing advanced Insider Security to an organization and defending the infrastructure form cyber attacks
